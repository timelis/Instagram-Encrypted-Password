# What's this?
Generate an encrypted password for Instagram (version 1)

# Why you need version 1
If version 1 is used, as of my check:

You need a Version 1 encrypted password to log in or create a new account on a terminal that has never logged in or created a new account.

# Important points
The public key or key id may change. Please let me know if this code no longer works.
